     			 <p> Once the boy got here through the portal to discover all of his riches he was very pleased.</p>

     			 <p> He had been rewarded all of the material things that his heart desired. </p>

     			 <p> With all the riches he gained came a price. He was cursed. </p>

     			<P> He must spend all of enternity in isolation. With all of his money and wealth forever. </p>

     			<p> All he had in life now was material things. With no one to share his material things with.</p>

     			<p> No friends, family or love in his life.</p>
