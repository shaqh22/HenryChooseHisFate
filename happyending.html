					<p>They all went on living in the same small house for their entire lives. </p> 

				    <p> The three kids grew up to become very different individuals.</p> 

				    <p> Leo was the eldest and it showed in his bossy personality.</p> 

				    <p> Serentity was the middle child and altholugh she was beautiful like her mom she was a very shy girl.</p>
